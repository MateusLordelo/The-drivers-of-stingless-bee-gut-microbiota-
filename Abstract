Abstract 
Eusocial bee gut microbiota can be influenced by diet, environment, caste, sex, and development. While these dynamics are well studied in honey bees and bumble bees, they remain largely unknown in stingless bees. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the gut microbiota of Melipona capixaba and Melipona mondury across developmental stages (larvae, nurses, and foragers), and across castes (workers and queens) and sexes (males and females) in M. mondury. We integrated taxonomic profiling, alpha and beta diversity analyses, differential abundance testing, and functional predictions to identify the ecological drivers of microbiome structure. Our results show that microbial composition is structured by developmental stage, driven by an interaction of environmental contact, social behaviour, and diet. Workers and males harbour richer and more even communities, reflecting their greater contact with the external environment. Socially integrated workers were dominated by typical bee-associated core taxa, including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Commensalibacter, whereas males were enriched in transient and environmentally derived genera such as Erwinia and Morganella. Nurses exhibited intermediary microbiotas overlapping those of larvae and foragers, supporting a progressive model of microbial acquisition mediated by in-nest social interactions. In contrast, larvae and queens possessed less diverse and highly uneven communities dominated by fermentative and acid-tolerant taxa adapted to sugar-rich, low-oxygen diets. Both virgin and physogastric queens were consistently dominated by Erysipelatoclostridium sp. (>50% relative abundance), indicating that queen microbiota composition is relatively insensitive to reproductive physiology and hormonal state. Further predictive functional profiling indicated that worker and male microbiota is specialized for environmental resilience and oxidative metabolism, while larvae and queens are enriched in pathways for fermentation and detoxification. Together, these results demonstrate that stingless bee gut microbiota is finely tuned to host identity, developmental stage, and ecological role. Our findings highlight the importance of treating stingless bees as a distinct model of eusocial microbiome evolution and provide new insight into how social structure and environmental exposure shape microbial function at the colony level.
